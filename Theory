# Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is an instance of classification technique that you can use to predict a qualitative response. 
More specifically, logistic regression models the probability that response belongs to a particular category.

# That means that, if you are trying to do response classification, where the response falls into one of the
# two categories, such as male or female, we'll use logistic regression models to estimate the probability that gender
# belongs to a particular category

# Binomial Logistic Regression 
 The variable to predict (response) is binary ("1" or "0"), however, logistic regression can also be used
 to predict a dependent variable which can assume more than 2 values.

# Multinomial Logistic Regression
# MLR model is a simple extension of the binomial logistic regression model, which you use
# when the exploratory variable has more than two nominal (unordered) categories.

#In multinomial logistic regression, the exploratory variable is dummy coded into multiple 1/0 variables.
3There is a variable for all categories but one, so if there are M categories, there will be M−1 dummy variables.
Each category’s dummy variable has a value of 1 for its category and a 0 for all others. One category, the reference category, 
doesn’t need its own dummy variable, as it is uniquely identified by all the other variables being 0.

The mulitnomial logistic regression then estimates a separate binary logistic regression model for each of those dummy variables. 
The result is M−1 binary logistic regression models. Each model conveys the effect of predictors
on the probability of success in that category, in comparison to the reference category.
